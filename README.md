Team Members: Mike, Lea, & Nikki

Project Title: Craft Beer Demographics and Distribution

Description: We want to establish at target distribution area based on key demographics for craft breweries. We will show craft breweries steady growth year over year which results in local job growth.

Data: Census data, Age Data, Race Data, Socioeconomic Data, Gender Data, & brewery publications. We will run Api calls to google place. We will research are key demographics to save time. 

3-5 Initial research questions: Where are the craft breweries? Where are the most densely populated demographics? Where are they currently distributing? What are the distribution platforms? 

Techniques & tools: Google API, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Power Point, Local Brewery

Data Shortcomings: Time constraints on the demographics on our own, moving target on what craft beer is. Everyone is mobile, and people move and relocate.
